## Writeup (TL;DR)
QA Assist is an exploratory testing assistant built for rapid bug capture and AI-assisted analysis. A Chrome extension records video, console/network logs, and interaction context while testers annotate sessions. A Phoenix backend stores sessions and artifacts, and an ADK-powered AI service analyzes chunks, produces issue summaries, and suggests repro steps. A web app provides playback, a timeline, logs, annotations, and a chat UI for analysis follow-ups.

## Autonomy timeline requirement
- Ensure ADK is enabled with a valid API key so the Agent Timeline is populated during the demo.
