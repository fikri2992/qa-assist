# Web App (Tailwind)

## Views
- **Session list** (device-scoped, synced with backend)
- **Session detail**:
  - Video playback with timeline
  - Chunk boundary markers
  - Logs panel (console + network)
  - Interaction trail (clicks + DOM context)
  - Annotations overlay
  - AI analysis status badge and final report
  - Chat UI with model/mode selector and stop button
  - Downloadable repro scripts (e.g., Playwright)

## UX notes
- Show per-chunk analysis badge as results complete.
- Reveal full aggregated report after session end.
- Keep UI minimal for hackathon demo.
