# Problem and Goals

## Problem statement
QA engineers need a fast way to record exploratory testing sessions (video, logs, actions) and produce actionable bug reports with reproducible steps and evidence.

## Primary users
- QA engineers performing exploratory testing.
- Developers reviewing reports and evidence.

## Goals (MVP)
- Record active-tab video, console logs, network logs, and user interactions.
- Allow markers/annotations during a session.
- Capture environment metadata (window/screen size, OS, browser version).
- Store session artifacts in a backend for analysis and later review.
- Run AI analysis per video chunk and present a final aggregated report after session end.

## Non-goals (MVP)
- Cross-browser support (Chrome only).
- Authentication or sharing across devices/users.
- Real-time collaboration or live streaming to multiple viewers.
